1) Find out all fields that are prompt type from prompt_filter.json
2) For all prompt fields from step 1 find out matching original field from all_fields.json
3) Based on their data type display a HTML form, like text type will be text box, number type will be number and date type will be date.
4) The prompt fields which are not filled by user, should be completely removed from the prompt_filter.json, if rule list is empty it should also be removed.
5) prompt fields those are filled by user will contain the value:<value filled by user>.
6) final JSON should be like final_out.json



Notes:

promt_filter.json is just one example. By keeping the structure and tags same, json can go to any nested hierarchy.
